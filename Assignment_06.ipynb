    "Please read the tasks description carefully and implement **only** what the tasks ask you to implement. Closely following the task descriptions will be beneficial, so keep your divergence in check - the test cases below each input cell are the gold standard. Finally, for this assignment, you do not need any error handling, you can assume that all input to your function will be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the other assignments, using `print` is encouraged to test your implementation but is never required. Make sure not to confuse `return` and `print` statements: If your function has to **return** something, use the `return` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try to implement the tasks yourself or in a small team. If you blindly copy a solution from the Internet or other students, you will not take home any learnings. Rather, make an effort to understand the solution! Furthermore, do not modify the _test cells_ - if you do, you effectively cheat the system which is not helpful for your learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some aspects of this assignment require you to <strong>self-study</strong> and do some research beyond the lecture contents - use your favorite search engine to look up documentation, usage examples, and definitions of the mentioned functions. There might be tasks where you have to read and investigate the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) to find the documentation for a function that is used or that you want to use.\n",

    "In this task, you will get some practical experience on top of the theoretical knowledge about networks that were discussed during the lectures. Make sure that you are able to answer the following questions - they will prepare you for Task 2 of this assignment and the final exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **We will not provide a solution for this Task. It is meant as a repitition of what Simon showed you in the lecture.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 1**: What is the purpose of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)? What is the purpose of the sequence numbers that are embedded in TCP packets?\n",
    "- **Question 2**: Install and use the [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to analyze the network traffic of your computer. Just like Simon showed in the lecture, start recording your \"main network interface\" that is connected to the Internet (e.g., en0, Wi-Fi, etc.) with Wireshark and open http://example.com in your browser, then stop the Wireshark recording. In Wireshark, identify the HTTP packet your machine sent to the remote server example.com (IP address: `93.184.216.34`) by applying a filter `ip.addr == 93.184.216.34`. Click that packet to see its details, which are displayed conveniently split by networking layer, and find answers to the following questions:\n",
    "    - **Network Layer (IP)**:\n",
    "        - **Question 2.1**: Which version of the IP protocol was used?\n",
    "        - **Question 2.2**: What is the source IP address (i.e. your machine's IP) and what is the destination IP address?\n",
    "    - **Transport Layer (TCP)**:\n",
    "        - **Question 2.3**: What local port did your Web browser use to communicate with the server that hosts `example.com`?\n",
    "        - **Question 2.4**: At what port does the remote server listen to incoming requests?\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Application Layer (HTTP)**:\n",
    "        - **Question 2.5**: In the packet, what is the payload that your machine sent to the remote server?\n",
    "        - **Question 2.6**: Which version of the HTTP protocol was used to send this payload?\n",
    "        - **Question 2.7**: What is the value of the Content-Type header?\n",
    "        - **Question 2.8**: What is the name of the HTTP Method that your browser used to retrieve data from `example.com`?\n",
    "- **Question 3**: From the raw HTTP response of the previous task, note the meaning and the values of the following parameters:\n",
    "    - The HTTP Status Code\n",
    "    - The Content-Type header\n",
    "    - The Content-Length header\n",
    "- **Question 4**: The response to your request in the previous exercise most probably includes an HTTP status code of 200 OK. Look up the semantics of the following HTTP status codes:\n",
    "    - 304 Not Modified\n",
    "    - 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "    - 404 Not Found\n",
    "    - 418 I'm a Teapot\n",
    "- **Question 5**: Finally, clear the filter ip.addr == 93.184.216.34 from Wireshark, and request the secure Website https://unisg.ch in your browser. You should now observe lots of packets that use the TLS protocol to communicate with the server hosting that website. Try to read the payload of any of these packets! Why can you not find any HTTP packets from your interaction with https://unisg.ch in the traffic?\n",

    "\n",
    "**GOAL: Use the Yelp Fusion API with an API key to get a list of restaurants that are a) open at a specific time and b) within a specific radius of a given geographical location.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP security\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**Yelp Fusion API**](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) is a Web API that provides information about local businesses, events and user reviews across 32 countries. In comparison to the public Transport API of Task 2.2, The Yelp Fusion API is private and requires **user authentication**. The HTTP Protocol [defines different Authentication Schemes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes/http-authschemes.xhtml). The Yelp Fusion API uses one of them, namely the **Bearer Authentication Scheme** which involves security tokens called **bearer tokens: The API gives access to the bearers of such tokens.** Based on the [Yelp Authentication Guide](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication), in order to use the API, we need to:\n",
    "1. [Register](https://www.yelp.com/signup) to Yelp and [request a private API key](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app). (Note: The second link will work only if you logged in to Yelp).\n",
    "2. Set the value of \"Authorization\" to `Bearer API_KEY_VALUE` in the **HTTP header of any HTTP requests**. This way the API calls will get authenticated with the API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we set up the **HTTP header** of a request, we can proceed by defining the **request parameters**. For example, we can send an **HTTP GET request** to https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search to search for businesses with the following **parameters**: \n",

    "    \"radius\": 500,\n",
    "    \"categories\": \"collegeuniv\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [documentation of the Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) the above **request parameters** specify that we want to get the [colleges and universities](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/all_category_list) in St. Gallen within a radius of 500m.
